  "description": "Spry allows developers to test a specific object without having to test dependency objects that the subject under test uses. Spyable allows a developer to check whether or not a function was called on an object with the correct arguments. Stubbable allows a developer to stub return values (or the entire implementation of a function) to ensure proper encapsulation during tests.",
